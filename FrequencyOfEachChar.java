/* The given Java program calculates and displays the frequency of each character in an input string. It first takes input from the user and converts it into a character array. The program then iterates through each character and checks if it has already been counted by scanning previous characters in the array. If the character has not been counted before, it counts its occurrences in the entire string and prints the frequency. The use of nested loops makes this approach inefficient for large inputs, as it results in a time complexity of O(nÂ²)*/
