# Java
This repository contains a mini project with several Java programs that demonstrate the use of Graphical User Interface (GUI) components to perform different tasks. The project includes a Factorial Calculator that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using a simple GUI, a Mini Bidding Station that allows users to place bids on items categorized as electronic, fashion, or home, and an Eligibility to Vote Checker that determines if a user is eligible to vote based on their age. The programs make use of various Java GUI components like JFrame, JTextField, JRadioButton, and event listeners to interact with the user. This project serves as a practical example for beginners to understand the basics of GUI programming in Java, including input handling, event-driven architecture, and simple business logic.
