# Java OOP Concepts Demonstration

This repository contains Java programs that exemplify the four fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Each program in this collection is designed to illustrate a specific OOP concept, providing clear and concise examples to aid in understanding these foundational principles.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

- **EncapsulationDemo.java** â€“ Demonstrates encapsulation by restricting direct access to object data through the use of private fields and public getter/setter methods.
- **InheritanceDemo.java** â€“ Illustrates inheritance by showing how a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass.
- **PolymorphismDemo.java** â€“ Exhibits polymorphism by allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling dynamic method invocation.
- **AbstractionDemo.java** â€“ Showcases abstraction by defining abstract classes and methods to represent common characteristics of subclasses.

## ðŸš€ Features

Clear examples of each OOP pillar  
Well-commented code for better understanding  
Practical implementations demonstrating real-world scenarios
